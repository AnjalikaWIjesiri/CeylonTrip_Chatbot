## 2) Seasons & When to Go (Quick Map)
- **West & South Coasts (Negombo → Galle → Mirissa → Tangalle):** generally best **Nov–Mar**. Summer seas can be rough.
- **East Coast (Trincomalee / Nilaveli, Passikudah, Arugam Bay):** generally best **May–Sep** (calmer seas, surf in A’Bay).
- **Hill Country (Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Ella, Horton Plains):** cooler year-round; clearer conditions often **Jan–Apr** and **Jul–Sep**; expect mist/rain around **Oct–Dec**.
- **North (Jaffna):** drier conditions often **Jan–Apr** and **Jun–Sep**.

> **Tip:** For beach-focused trips, align coast with season to maximize calm waters and sunshine.

## 3) Money, Payments & Tipping
- **Currency:** Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR). ATMs in cities and major towns; smaller towns may be cash-heavy.
- **Cards:** Hotels and mid/high-end venues often accept cards; small shops, tuk‑tuks, markets are usually **cash**.
- **Exchange:** Use bank counters or ATMs. Keep small notes for buses, snacks, and short rides.
- **Tipping (guideline):** Restaurants may add a service charge; if not, ~**10%** is common at mid-range places. Round up for taxis/tuk‑tuks and porters.
- **Haggling:** Normal at markets and for some transport/tours—be polite, compare prices, and confirm **before** starting.

## 4) Connectivity (SIM, eSIM, Wi‑Fi)
- **Local SIM:** Prepaid SIMs are widely available at the airport and in cities. Major operators offer tourist packages with data.
- **eSIM:** Increasingly available—confirm device compatibility beforehand.
- **Coverage:** Good across cities and main routes; more variable in national parks and remote areas.
- **Ride-hailing:** Apps (e.g., **PickMe**, and similar services) operate in major cities; useful to benchmark tuk‑tuk fares.

---

## 5) Getting Around (Trains, Buses, Cars, Tuk‑tuks)
- **Trains:** Scenic hill‑country routes (e.g., **Kandy ↔ Ella**) are famous. Reserved seats can sell out; unreserved is possible but may be crowded. Expect slower but beautiful travel.
- **Buses:** Extensive network, very budget-friendly. Keep small change; expect basic comfort and frequent stops.
- **Car/Driver:** Efficient for multi-stop itineraries and families. Clarify price **all‑in** (fuel, tolls, driver’s meals/lodging if overnight).
- **Tuk‑tuks:** Great for short hops. Agree a fare or use a meter/ride‑hailing app when available.
- **Domestic flights:** Limited routes and variable schedules—treat as optional, not guaranteed.

> **Time estimates:** Road & rail times vary with weather, traffic, roadworks, and holidays. Always allow buffer time—especially for airport transfers and safari starts.

## 6) Safety, Health & Hygiene

- **Emergency & Medical:** Identify nearby clinics/pharmacies at each stop. For serious issues, seek hospital care in larger towns/cities.
